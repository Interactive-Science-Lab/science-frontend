Asteroid Folder Structure & Overview

Quick Overview: A react / node application base that automatically sets up components based on configuration files
Essentially, define the functionality of a REST resource in a file and have that component set up automatically

    Main folders in /src
================================
/main- all the "main" files for default functionality.
/site - for modifying site options, things that are commonly changed from one site to another despite functionality (Site name & links, etc.)
/project- for adding custom codes & functionality outside of the scope of what ASTEROID covers
/stylesheets- has all the scss stylesheets

    /main
====================
Where most of the meat of a default application is stored
 -- /asteroid- class information & other things that build the core of this app
 -- /defaultComponent- the structure of the "default" component- the one that all resources follow by default
 -- /structure - holds information about the structure of the site OUTSIDE of individual components, header, footer, etc.

    /site
====================
Change site options in the /site folder
 -- siteSettings.js- things like logo and hooking up the backend links
 -- appComponent.js- where we connect all the components in /componentFiles
 -- /componentFiles- where to store & edit all components.
 -- home.js- the home screen
 -- privacy-policy.js- as it sounds

    /project
====================
Where you're able to include literally whatever files you want
 -- It's an empty folder.

    /stylesheets
====================
The stylesheets, of course.

    /helpers
====================
Contains any app wide helpers.
 -- api.js- has curr_user, and an api_path helper that make it easy to call the correct url.
